
- replace the ListView on the threaded view with a TableLayout, and then 
  track the clicks on the row in an attempt to show the row clicked on in 
  touch mode... Google doesn't think that touches on listviews should show 
  and indication of what was last pressed, and there seems to be no way to 
  implement this by default.
